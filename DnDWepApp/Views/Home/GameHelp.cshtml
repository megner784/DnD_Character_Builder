 <p>
     YOUR FIRST STEP IN PLAYING AN ADVENTURER IN THE
     D u n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s  game is to imagine and create a character of your own. Your
     character is a com bination of game statistics, role playing hooks, and your imagination. You 
     choose a race (such as human or halfling) and a class (such as fighter or wizard). You also
     invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character. Once completed, your character serves 
     as your representative in the game, your avatar in the D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s world.
</p>

<p>
    Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the kind of adventurer you want to play. You might be a 
    courageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or a flamboyant wizard. Or you might be more interested 
    in an unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who 
    picks off enemies from afar. Do you like fantasy fiction featuring dwarves or elves? Try building a character of 
    one of those races. Do you want your character to be the toughest adventurer at the table? Consider a class like 
    barbarian or paladin. If you don’t know where else to begin, take a look at the illustrations in this help section to see 
    what catches your interest.
</p>

<p>
    Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character you
    want. Your conception of your character might evolve with each choice you make. What’s important is that you
    come to the table with a character you’re excited to play.
</p>

<p>
    Throughout this chapter, we use the term character sheet to mean whatever you use to track your character,
    whether it’s a form or character sheet, some form of digital record, or a piece of notebook paper. An official 
    D&D character sheet is a fine place to start until you know what information you
    need and how you use it during the game.
</p>

<h2>B u i l d i n g   B r u e n o r </h2>

<p>
    Each step of character creation includes an example of that step, with a player named Bob building his dwarf
    character, Bruenor.
</p>

<h2 id="choose-a-race"> 1. C h o o s e  A   R a c e </h2>

<p>
    Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the D&D world. The
    most common player character races are dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans. Some races also have subraces,
    such as mountain dw arf or w ood elf. Chapter 2 provides m ore inform ation about these races, as well as the less
    widespread races of dragonborn, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs, and tieflings.
</p>

<p>
    The race you choose contributes to your character’s identity in an important way, by establishing a general
    appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character’s race grants particular
    racial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more
    skills, or the ability to use minor spells. These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain
    classes (see step 2). For example, the racial traits of lightfoot halflings make them exceptional rogues, and
    high elves tend to be powerful wizards. Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too. Half-orc paladins
    and mountain dwarf wizards, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.
</p>

<p>
    Your race also increases one or more of your ability scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these
    increases and remember to apply them later.
    </p>

<p>
    Record the traits granted by your race on your character sheet. Be sure to note your starting
    languages and your base speed as well.
</p>

<h2 id="building-bruenor-step1"> B u i l d i n g   B r u e n o r,  S t e p 1 </h2>

<p>
    Bob is sitting down to create his character. He decides that a gruff mountain dwarf fits the character he wants
    to play. He notes all the racial traits of dwarves on his character sheet, including his speed of 25 feet and the
    languages he knows: Common and Dwarvish.
<p>

<h2 id="choose-a-class"> 2.  C h o o s e   A   C l a s s </h2>

<p>
    Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he
    or she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters,
    or engaging in a tense negotiation. The character classes are described in chapter 3.
</p>

<p>
    Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are class
    features—capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes.
    You also gain a number of proficiencies: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools.
    Your proficiencies define many of the things your character can do particularly well, from using certain
    weapons to telling a convincing lie.
</p>
    
<p>
    On your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level.
</p>
    
<h3>L e v e l</h3>

<p>
    Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining experience points
    (XP). A 1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although he or she might have been
    a soldier or a pirate and done dangerous things before.
</p>

<p>
    Starting off at 1st level marks your character’s entry into the adventuring life. If you’re already familiar
    with the game, or if you are joining an existing D&D campaign, your DM might decide to have you begin at a
    higher level, on the assumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing adventures.
</p>

<h3>Q u i c k     B u i l d </h3>

<p>
    Each class description in chapter 3 includes a section offering suggestions to quickly build a character of that
    class, including how to assign your highest ability scores, a background suitable to the class, and starting spells.
</p>

<p>
    Record your level on your character sheet. If you’re starting at a higher level, record the additional elements
    your class gives you for your levels past 1st. Also record your experience points. A 1st-level character has 0
    X P A higher-level character typically begins with the minimum amount of X P required to reach that level
    (see “Beyond 1st Level” later in this chapter).
</p>

<h3> Hits Points And Hit Dice </h3>

<p>
Your character’s hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. 
Your hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).
</p>

<p>
    At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class. You start with hit 
    points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. (You also add your Constitution 
    modifier, which you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also your hit point maximum.
</p>

<p>
    Record your character’s hit points on your character sheet. Also record the type of Hit Die your character 
    uses and the number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see 
    “Resting” in chapter 8).
</p>

<h3>P r o f i c i e n c y    B o n u s</h3>

<p>
    The table that appears in your class description shows your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level 
    character. Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you’ll be recording on your character sheet:
</p>

<p>Attack rolls using w eapons you’re proficient with:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Attack rolls with spells you cast</li>
    <li>Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in</li>
    <li>Ability checks using tools you’re proficient with</li>
    <li>Saving throws you’re proficient in</li>
    <li>Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each spellcasting class)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill 
and tool proficiencies. (Skills are described in chapter 7, tools in chapter 5.) Your background gives you additional
skill and tool proficiencies, and some races give you more proficiencies. Be sure to note all of these 
proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.
</p>

<p>
    Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. Occasionally, your
    proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance
    suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll or that it should be multiplied
    more than once, you nevertheless add it only once, multiply it only once, and halve it only once.
</p>

<h2 id="building-bruenor-step2"> B u i l d i n g    B r u e n o r,  S t e p   2</h2>

<p>
    Bob imagines Bruenor charging into battle with an axe, one horn on his helmet broken off. He makes Bruenor a 
    fighter and notes the fighter’s proficiencies and 1st-level class features on his character sheet.
</p>

<p>
    As a 1st-level fighter, Bruenor has 1 Hit Die—a d10— and starts with hit points equal to 10 + his Constitution 
    modifier. Bob notes this, and will record the final number after he determines Bruenor’s Constitution 
    score (see step 3). Bob also notes the proficiency bonus for a 1st-level character, which is +2.
</p>

<h2 id="determine-ability-scores"> 3.  D e t e r m i n e   A b i l i t y   S c o r e s </h2>

<p>
    Much of what your character does in the game depends 
    on his or her six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, 
    Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.
    Each ability has a score, which is a number you record 
    on your character sheet.
</p>

<p>
    The six abilities and their use in the game are 
    described in chapter 7. The Ability Score Summary
    table provides a quick reference for what qualities 
    are measured by each ability, what races increases 
    which abilities, and what classes consider each ability 
    particularly important.
</p>

<p>
    You generate your character's six ability scores 
    randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of 
    the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do 
    this five more times, so that you have six numbers. If 
    you want to save time or don’t like the idea of randomly 
    determining ability scores, you can use the following 
    scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.
</p>

<p>
    Now take your six numbers and write each number 
    beside one of your character’s six abilities to assign 
    scores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, 
    W isdom , and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes 
    to your ability scores as a result of your race choice.
</p>

<p>
    After assigning your ability scores, determine 
    your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and 
    Modifiers table. To determine an ability modifier without 
    consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score 
    and then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the 
    modifier next to each of your scores.
</p>

<h2 id="building-bruenor-step3"> B u i l d i n g   B r u e n o r , S t e p   3 </h2>

<p>
    Bob decides to use the standard set of scores (15, 14,
    13, 12, 10, 8) for Bruenor’s abilities. Since he’s a fighter,
    he puts his highest score, 15, in Strength. His next-
    highest, 14, goes in Constitution. Bruenor might be a
    brash fighter, but Bob decides he wants the dwarf to
    be older, wiser, and a good leader, so he puts decent
    scores in Wisdom and Charisma. After applying his
    racial benefits (increasing Bruenor’s Constitution by
    2 and his Strength by 2), Bruenor’s ability scores and
    modifiers look like this: Strength 17 (+3), Dexterity 10
    (+0), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 8 (-1), Wisdom 13
    (+1), Charisma 12 (+1).
</p>

<p>
    Bob fills in Bruenor's final hit points: 10 + his
    Constitution modifier of +3, for a total of 13 hit points.
</p>

<h3>V a r i a n t:  C u s t o m i z i n g   A b i l i t y    S c o r e s </h3>

<p>
At your Dungeon Master’s option, you can use this 
variant for determining your ability scores. The method 
described here allows you to build a character with a set 
of ability scores you choose individually.
</p>

<p>
You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. 
The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score 
Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 
points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score 
you can end up with, before applying racial increases. 
You can’t have a score lower than 8.
</p>

<p>
This method of determining ability scores enables 
you to create a set of three high numbers and three low 
ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above
average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any
set of numbers between those extremes.

<h2 id="describe-your-character"> 4.  D e s c r i b e   Y o u r    C h a r a c t e r </h2>

<p>
Once you know the basic game aspects of your 
character, it’s time to flesh him or her out as a person. 
Your character needs a name. Spend a few minutes 
thinking about what he or she looks like and how he or
she behaves in general terms.
</p>

<p>
Using the information in chapter 4, you can flesh out
your character’s physical appearance and personality 
traits. Choose your character’s alignment (the moral 
compass that guides his or her decisions) and ideals. 
Chapter 4 also helps you identify the things your 
character holds most dear, called bonds, and the flaws
that could one day undermine him or her.
</p>

<p>
Your character’s background describes where he or
she came from, his or her original occupation, and the 
character’s place in the D&D world. Your DM might 
offer additional backgrounds beyond the ones included
in chapter 4, and might be willing to work with you to 
craft a background that’s a more precise fit for your 
character concept.
</p>

<p>
A background gives your character a background 
feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills, 
and it might also give you additional languages or 
proficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record this 
information, along with the personality information 
you develop, on your character sheet.
</p>

<h3>Y o u r   C h a r a c t e r ’s   A b i l i t i e s</h3>

<p>
    Take your character’s ability scores and race into
    account as you flesh out his or her appearance
    and personality. A very strong character with low
    Intelligence might think and behave very differently
    from a very smart character with low Strength.
</p>

<p>
    For example, high Strength usually corresponds
    with a burly or athletic body, while a character with
    low Strength might be scrawny or plump.
</p>

<p>
    A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and
    slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be
    either gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.
</p>

<p>
    A character with high Constitution usually looks
    healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A
    character with low Constitution might be sickly or frail.
</p>

<p>
    A character with high Intelligence might be highly
    inquisitive and studious, while a character with low
    Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details.
</p>

<p>
    A character with high Wisdom has good judgment,
    empathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on.
    A character with low Wisdom might be absent-minded,
    foolhardy, or oblivious.
</p>

<p>
    A character with high Charisma exudes confidence,
    which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating
    presence. A character with a low Charisma might come
    across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.
</p>

<h2>B u i l d i n g  B r u e n o r, S t e p 4</h2>

<p>
    Bob fills in some of Bruenor’s basic details: his name,
    his sex (male), his height and weight, and his alignment
    (lawful good). His high Strength and Constitution
    suggest a healthy, athletic body, and his low Intelligence
    suggests a degree of forgetfulness.
</p>

<p>
    Bob decides that Bruenor comes from a noble line,
    but his clan was expelled from its homeland when
    Bruenor was very young. He grew up working as a smith
    in the remote villages of Icewind Dale. But Bruenor
    has a heroic destiny to reclaim his homeland—so
    Bob chooses the folk hero background for his dwarf.
    He notes the proficiencies and special feature this
    background gives him.

<p>
    Bob has a pretty clear picture of Bruenor’s personality
    in mind, so he skips the personality traits suggested in
    the folk hero background, noting instead that Bruenor is
    a caring, sensitive dwarf who genuinely loves his friends
    and allies, but he hides this soft heart behind a gruff,
    snarling demeanor. He chooses the ideal of fairness
    from the list in his background, noting that Bruenor
    believes that no one is above the law.
</p>

<p>
    Given his history, Bruenor’s bond is obvious: he
    aspires to someday reclaim Mithral Hall, his homeland,
    from the shadow dragon that drove the dwarves out.
    His flaw is tied to his caring, sensitive nature—he has a
    soft spot for orphans and wayward souls, leading him to
    show mercy even when it might not be warranted.

<p>
    Your class and background determine your character's
    starting equipment, including weapons, armor, and
    other adventuring gear. Record this equipment on your
    character sheet. All such items are detailed in chapter 5.
</p>

<p>
    Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class
    and background, you can purchase your starting
    equipment. You have a number of gold pieces (gp)
    to spend based on your class, as shown in chapter 5.
    Extensive lists of equipment, with prices, also appear in
    that chapter. If you wish, you can also have one trinket
    at no cost (see the trinket table at the end of chapter 5).
</p>

<p>
    Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can
    carry. Try not to purchase equipment with a total weight
    (in pounds) exceeding your Strength score times 15.
    Chapter 7 has more information on carrying capacity.
</p>

<h3>A r m o r   C l a s s</h3>

<p>
    Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well your
    character avoids being wounded in battle. Things that
    contribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the
    shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all
    characters wear armor or carry shields, however.
</p>

<p>
    Without arm or or a shield, your character’s AC equals
    10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character
    wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your
    AC using the rules in chapter 5. Record your AC on
    your character sheet.
</p>

<p>
    Your character needs to be proficient with armor and
    shields to wear and use them effectively, and your armor
    and shield proficiencies are determined by your class.
    There are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a
    shield if you lack the required proficiency, as explained
    in chapter 5.
</p>

<p>
    Some spells and class features give you a different
    way to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features
    that give you different ways to calculate your AC, you
    choose which one to use.
</p>

<h3>W e a p o n s</h3>

<p>
For each weapon your character wields, calculate the 
modifier you use when you attack with the weapon and 
the damage you deal when you hit.
</p>

<p>
When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll 
a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you 
are proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate 
ability modifier.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    For attacks with melee weapons, use your Strength 
    modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that 
    has the finesse property, such as a rapier, can use your
    Dexterity modifier instead.
    </li>

    <li>
    For attacks with ranged weapons, use your Dexterity 
    modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that 
    has the thrown property, such as a handaxe, can use 
    your Strength modifier instead.
    </li>

</ul>

<h2>B u i l d i n g   B r u e n o r,  S t e p  5</h2>

<p>
    Bob writes down the starting equipment from the
    fighter class and the folk hero background. His starting
    equipment includes chain mail and a shield, which
    combine to give Bruenor an Armor Class of 18.
</p>

<p>
    For Bruenor’s weapons, Bob chooses a battleaxe
    and two handaxes. His battleaxe is a melee weapon,
    so Bruenor uses his Strength modifier for his attacks
    and damage. His attack bonus is his Strength modifier
    (+3) plus his proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +5.
    The battleaxe deals 1d8 slashing damage, and Bruenor
    adds his Strength modifier to the damage when he
    hits, for a total of 1d8 + 3 slashing damage. When
    throwing a handaxe, Bruenor has the same attack bonus
    (handaxes, as thrown weapons, use Strength for attacks
    and damage), and the weapon deals 1d6 + 3 slashing
    damage when it hits.
</p>

<h2 id="come-together">6.  C o m e    T o g e t h e r </h2>

<p>
Most D & D characters don’t work alone. Each character 
plays a role within a party, a group of adventurers 
working together for a common purpose. Teamwork 
and cooperation greatly improve your party’s chances 
to survive the many perils in the worlds o f  D u n g e o n s 
&  D r a g o n s . Talk to your fellow players and your DM 
to decide whether your characters know one another, 
how they met, and what sorts of quests the group 
might undertake.
</p>

<h3>B e y o n d   1st   L e v e l</h3>

<p>
    As your character goes on adventures and overcomes
    challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by
    experience points. A character who reaches a specified
    experience point total advances in capability. This
    advancement is called gaining a level.
</p>

<p>
    When your character gains a level, his or her class
    often grants additional features, as detailed in the
    class description. Som e of these features allow you
    to increase your ability scores, either increasing two
    scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can’t
    increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every
    character’s proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.
</p>

<p>
    Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit
    Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier
    to the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum.
    Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your
    class entry, which is the average result of the die roll
    (rounded up).
</p>

<p>
    When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your
    hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have
    attained. For example, when Bruenor reaches 8th level
    as a fighter, he increases his Constitution score from 17
    to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3
    to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.
</p>

<p>
    The Character Advancement table summarizes the
    XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through
    level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that
    level. Consult the information in your character’s class
    description to see what other improvements you gain
    at each level.
</p>

<h3>T i e r s   o f    P l a y </h3>

<p>
    The shading in the Character Advancement table shows
    the four tiers of play. The tiers don’t have any rules
    associated with them; they are a general description of how
    the play experience changes as characters gain levels.
</p>

<p>
    In the first tier (levels 1-4), characters are effectively
    apprentice adventurers. They are learning the features
    that define them as members of particular classes,
    including the major choices that favor their class
    features as they advance (such as a wizard’s Arcane
    Tradition or a fighter’s Martial Archetype). The threats
    they face are relatively minor, usually posing a danger to
    local farmsteads or villages.
</p>

<p>
    In the second tier (levels 5-10), characters come into
    their own. Many spellcasters gain access to 3rd-level
    spells at the start of this tier, crossing a new threshold of
    magical power with spells such as fireball and lightning
    bolt. At this tier, many weapon-using classes gain the
    ability to make multiple attacks in one round. These
    characters have become important, facing dangers that
    threaten cities and kingdoms.
</p>

<p>
    In the third tier (levels 11-16), characters have
    reached a level of power that sets them high above
    the ordinary populace and makes them special even
    among adventurers. At 11th level, many spellcasters
    gain access to 6th-level spells, some of which create
    effects previously impossible for player characters to
    achieve. Other characters gain features that allow them
    to make more attacks or do more impressive things with
    those attacks. These mighty adventurers often confront
    threats to whole regions and continents.
</p>

<p>
    At the fourth tier (levels 17-20), characters achieve
    the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic (or
    villainous) archetypes in their own right. The fate of the
    world or even the fundamental order of the multiverse
    might hang in the balance during their adventures.
