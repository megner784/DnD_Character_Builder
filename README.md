# D&D Character Builder Wep Application
 Dungeons & Dragons Character Builder Web Application

This web application will allow a D&D player to create a new
character from scratch or modify the attributes of an existing
character.  The search filters in the application provide a user with
options to retrieve character data based on selected attributes.  A
user generates random character abilities or selects from default
settings.  In addition, the application permits character updates and 
deletions.  The application provides a hardcopy character sheet to reflect
the player's character selection.  The motivation for developing 
this web application is to provide a way for players to enter 
game play faster by the easy and quick creation of D&D characters.
